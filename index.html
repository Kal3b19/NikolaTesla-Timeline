                            Tesla was born in the middle of the night on July 10, 1856, during a electrical storm, in Smiljan, 
                            now known as Croatia.Tesla's father was an orthdox priest, teacher and poet, 
                            his mother was a illiterate but highly intelligent, and also a master bead worker and tool maker.

                            , after a couple months back home his father suddenly dies. In 1880 tesla  leaves home to attends Karl-ferdinand university in prague
                            to carry out his fathers wish to complete school.

                            In 1881 Tesla leaves Prague and begins to work at Budapest telephone exchange, while at Budapest
                            Tesla continues his research for generating electricity through alternating currents.
                            In 1882 Tesla came up with the solution for creating the electromagnetic motor, while walking in a park with his friend
                            and reciting poems tesla was inspired and started designing the electromagnetic motor. After his electromagnetic discovery
                            Tesla accepted a job at Thomas Edision's new company in paris, where repaired and maintained direct current dynamo generators,
                            during his work at the company Tesla was able to build his first functioning model of an alternating currnet generator, 
                            in 1883 while working on a mission for the company in Strassburg, Alsac.

                            After leaving Edision's company Tesla forms a partnership with Benjamin Vale and Robert Lane to manufacture arc lighting.With this partnership 
                            The Tesla electric light and manufacturing operated from 1884-1886. The company shut down after Tesla's partners formed a new electric light and manufacturing company.

                            In 1886 Tesla was awarded his first U.S. patent for a Commutator for Dynamo electric motors.
                            In 1887 Tesla worked as a ditch digger after his partnership fell through. In his nex attemot to get investors 
                            Telsa comes up with a idea to create a machine to illustrate the concept of generationg  electricity through rotating magnectic fields.
                            He creates a electromagnectic motor that generates the force needed to spin a brass egg.After demostrating his machine Tesla was able to 
                            get funding from investors Alfred S. Brown and Charles F. Peck, starting the Tesla Electric Company.

                            and flouresent lighting powered the fair. With This Tesla proved that A/c wac superior to D/C to safely transmit power over a long distance to a large

                            Nikola Tesla sought to solve some of science’s greatest mysteries. The brilliant inventor had lived a remarkable life — 
                            churning out innovations like alternating-current electricity and presciently imagining a world of “wireless communication.” But when he died alone and broke in 1943 in New York City, he left behind a wealth of mysteries and what-ifs.
